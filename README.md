# AI in Software Engineering Coursework

This repository contains the completed assignments for the **AI in Software Engineering** course. The tasks demonstrate the use of AI tools for code completion, automated testing, and ethical considerations in AI-driven software development. Additionally, a bonus innovation task proposes an AI tool to solve a real-world software engineering challenge.

## Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

**Objective:**  
Use AI-powered code completion tools such as **GitHub Copilot** or **Tabnine** to implement a Python function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a specific key.

**Implementation Details:**  
- Manual implementation vs AI-assisted implementation  
- Comparison of efficiency, readability, and maintainability  

**Key Takeaways:**  
AI-assisted code completion accelerates development by providing syntactically correct suggestions, reducing the likelihood of errors, and suggesting optimized code patterns. The manual implementation allows deeper understanding of logic but is slower to write and verify.

**Deliverables:**  
- Python scripts (`task1_ai_code.py`)  
- 200-word analysis embedded in code comments

## Task 2: Automated Testing with AI

**Objective:**  
Automate a login page test case using Selenium and demonstrate AI-assisted testing benefits. The tests include both valid and invalid credentials.

**Implementation Details:**  
- Used **Selenium WebDriver** in headless Chrome mode  
- Test cases include:  
  1. Valid username and password (success expected)  
  2. Invalid username (failure expected)  
  3. Invalid password (failure expected)  
- Captured test results in a structured table using **Pandas**  
- Screenshot of test results saved for reporting  

**Benefits of AI in Testing:**  
- Generates additional test scenarios to cover edge cases  
- Reduces manual effort and human errors  
- Provides predictive insights into potential failure points  

**Deliverables:**  
- Python test script (`login_test.py`)  
- Screenshot of test results (`login_test_results.png`)  
- 150-word summary explaining AI advantages in test coverage

## Task 3: Ethical Reflection

**Objective:**  
Analyze potential biases in a predictive model deployed in a company and discuss how fairness tools can mitigate these biases.

**Implementation Details:**  
- Identified dataset biases (e.g., underrepresented teams or classes)  
- Discussed mitigation using **IBM AI Fairness 360** and similar fairness libraries  
- Highlighted the importance of fairness in AI decision-making  

**Deliverables:**  
- PDF file with a 200-word ethical reflection (`ethical_reflection.pdf`)  

---

## Bonus Task: AI Innovation Proposal

**Objective:**  
Propose a novel AI tool to solve a software engineering problem not covered in class.

**Implementation Details:**  
- Focused on solving challenges such as automated documentation generation or code review optimization  
- Outlined the AI tool’s purpose, workflow, and expected impact on productivity  

**Deliverables:**  
- One-page proposal in PDF (`ai_innovation_proposal.pdf`)
